Solar panels for when close enough to a star for them to work.

Per that source, it's roughly the distance from the sun to Jupiter for 4% of the sun's energy compared to earth.
This is 778 million km (5.2 AU) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter).
Not far enough to be effective for any long distance voyage, but would be useful at the destination.
